## [Daily reports (csse_covid_19_daily_reports)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports)

This folder contains daily case reports. All timestamps are in UTC (GMT+0).

### File naming convention
MM-DD-YYYY.csv in UTC.

### Field description
* <b>FIPS</b>: US only. Federal Information Processing Standards code that uniquely identifies counties within the USA.
* <b>Admin2</b>: County name. US only.
* <b>Province_State</b>: Province, state or dependency name.
* <b>Country_Region</b>: Country, region or sovereignty name. The names of locations included on the Website correspond with the official designations used by the U.S. Department of State.
* <b>Last Update</b>: MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:ss  (24 hour format, in UTC).
* <b>Lat</b> and <b>Long_</b>: Dot locations on the dashboard. All points (except for Australia) shown on the map are based on geographic centroids, and are not representative of a specific address, building or any location at a spatial scale finer than a province/state. Australian dots are located at the centroid of the largest city in each state.
* <b>Confirmed</b>: Counts include confirmed and probable (where reported).
* <b>Deaths</b>: Counts include confirmed and probable (where reported).
* <b>Recovered</b>: Recovered cases are estimates based on local media reports, and state and local reporting when available, and therefore may be substantially lower than the true number. US state-level recovered cases are from [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).
* <b>Active:</b> Active cases = total cases - total recovered - total deaths.
* <b>Incident_Rate</b>: Incidence Rate = cases per 100,000 persons.
* <b>Case_Fatality_Ratio (%)</b>: Case-Fatality Ratio (%) = Number recorded deaths / Number cases.
* All cases, deaths, and recoveries reported are based on the date of initial report. Exceptions to this are noted in the "Data Modification" and "Retrospective reporting of (probable) cases and deaths" subsections below.

### Data source
Global COVID-19 cases data files are daily updated from John Hopkins Institute at github [JHU Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports).



### End Use Cases
Considerando que o numero de casos durante a pandemia varia de forma diferente em cada pais, o objetivo inicial e criar  analitic tables para futura analise e desenvolvimento de deshboards.

Explain what end use cases you'd like to prepare the data for


<b>Step 1:</b> Scope the Project and Gather Data
Since the scope of the project will be highly dependent on the data, these two things happen simultaneously. In this step, you’ll:

Identify and gather the data you'll be using for your project (at least two sources and more than 1 million rows). See Project Resources for ideas of what data you can use.
Explain what end use cases you'd like to prepare the data for (e.g., analytics table, app back-end, source-of-truth database, etc.)

<b>Step 2:</b> Explore and Assess the Data
Explore the data to identify data quality issues, like missing values, duplicate data, etc.
Document steps necessary to clean the data

<b>Step 3:</b> Define the Data Model
Map out the conceptual data model and explain why you chose that model
List the steps necessary to pipeline the data into the chosen data model

<b>Step 4:</b> Run ETL to Model the Data
Create the data pipelines and the data model
Include a data dictionary
Run data quality checks to ensure the pipeline ran as expected
Integrity constraints on the relational database (e.g., unique key, data type, etc.)
Unit tests for the scripts to ensure they are doing the right thing
Source/count checks to ensure completeness

<b>Step 5:</b> Complete Project Write Up
What's the goal? What queries will you want to run? How would Spark or Airflow be incorporated? Why did you choose the model you chose?
Clearly state the rationale for the choice of tools and technologies for the project.
Document the steps of the process.
Propose how often the data should be updated and why.
Post your write-up and final data model in a GitHub repo.
Include a description of how you would approach the problem differently under the following scenarios:
If the data was increased by 100x.
If the pipelines were run on a daily basis by 7am.
If the database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.
