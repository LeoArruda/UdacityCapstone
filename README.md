* <b>Deaths</b>: Counts include confirmed and probable (where reported).
* <b>Recovered</b>: Recovered cases are estimates based on local media reports, and state and local reporting when available, and therefore may be substantially lower than the true number. US state-level recovered cases are from [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).

* <b>Incident_Rate</b>: Incidence Rate = cases per 100,000 persons.
* <b>Case_Fatality_Ratio (%)</b>: Case-Fatality Ratio (%) = Number recorded deaths / Number cases.
